# Crypto Currency Forecast
The following data science project is my final capstone as part of the HarvardX’s Data Science Professional
Certificate series.
Lately, the crypto currencies grab headlines when their value massively varied following bank announcements1
or Elon Musk’s. Then, the dataset of historic crypto currencies available on Kaggle website seems to promise
some relatable insights. Following an Exploration Data Analisys, I will seek for the best algorithms to forecast 
a couple of features available in the dataset.
Please, note that my 16GB-ram laptop was not powerfull enough all along. therefore an instance
-of type r5.4xlarge was created on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to run the code built with R version 4.0.2.
